# maps_web-app
This code is written for DOOPT LO and will be integrated with one of their websites. Unfortunately, this project will not work locally as it requires sensitive data for database integration which cannot be pushed to GitHub. However, current deployment is avaliable [here](https://se.math.spbu.ru/projects/maps_web-app/).

The interface provides data about routes, regions, objects, and equipment in LO. Filtering is enabled for regions and routes.
